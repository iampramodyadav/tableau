Week-1
## **Question 1**
True/False: As documented in the study: “The State of Business Intelligence and Business Analytics in Academia 2012,” recruiters from technical companies collectively rank SQL skills as the coursework/knowledge they look for most when recruiting for business intelligence/business analyst roles.

1 / 1 point

True


**False**

Correct
When academic researchers and the Teradata University Network ran the study, 400 recruiters from technical companies responded to the prompt: “When I recruit for Business Intelligence/Business Analyst roles, it is important that the students have the following coursework/knowledge.”  “Communication Skills” was the #1 answer companies gave, followed by “SQL and Query Skills” and “Basic Analytics.”

## **Question 2**
True/False: Everybody in the analytics world agrees that your job as a data analyst is to ask and answer the one, true, right question.

1 / 1 point

True


**False**

Correct
Although some of the language used in the business world does suggest that there is one, true, right question, many analysts have clarified that there can be many right questions in an analytics project.  Your job as an analyst is to make sure you ask as many questions as you need to get the information relevant to the problem you need to solve.

## **Question 3**
In this course, we used the S.M.A.R.T acronym to refer to goals that are:

1 / 1 point

Specific, Measureable, Active, Realistic, and Time-bound


**Specific, Measureable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound**


Specific, Measureable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-bound


Strategic, Measureable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound

Correct
The S.M.A.R.T. acronym we used in this course was Specific, Measureable,
Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound

## **Question 4**
Which of the following steps of the analytics project life cycle should you complete first?

1 / 1 point

Analyzing data


Making a data analysis plan


Making a dashboard


**Defining a SMART goal**

Correct
Although a S.M.A.R.T. goal could be revised if necessary, you want your team and stakeholders to sign off on a S.M.A.R.T. goal for the project before you make a plan for your data analysis or start the analysis itself.

## **Question 5**
True/False: Including the business metric that you will use to assess success in your business analytics project will make your project goal sufficiently specific to ensure success.

1 / 1 point

True

**False**

Correct
To make your project goal sufficiently specific, at minimum, you also need to specify exactly how and/or in what direction that business metric should change if your recommendations are put into action, and by how much.

## **Question 6**
Which of the SMART criteria are NOT met by this data analytics project goal (pay close attention to whether the options are words the SMART acronym stands for)?

The goal of this project is to, within 45 days, use the inventory, production, and customer service databases from national manufacturing plants to reduce the number of polo shirts returned for manufacturing defects. 

1 / 1 point

Attainable 


Time-bound


Measurable

**Specific**


Reasonable 

Correct
The goal was time-bound and measurable, but it wasn’t specific about how the measure should change in the time stated.  “Attainable” and “Reasonable” were not what we used the letters “A” and “R” to represent in this course.

## **Question 7**
True/False: Stakeholders are those individuals who are influenced by the outcome of your project or who might have a strong interest in it.

1 / 1 point

**True**


False

Correct


## **Question 8**
True/False: “Elicitation” refers to the process of writing a document that lists all the requirements and objectives of a data analysis project.


True


**False**

Correct
Although the result of elicitation might be a document that lists all the requirements and objectives of a data analysis project, business analysts will be responsible for gathering the information that allows those objectives to be defined. That gathering will require, as least in part, drawing out that information directly from your stakeholders. For more information see video Listening to Stakeholders during Elicitation or http://www.bridging-the-gap.com/requirements-gathering-vs-elicitation/.


## **Question 9**
You are an analyst at a bank.  Your bank ran a short-term experiment in which they provided credit cards to a wider range of applicants then normal, including applicants whose applications would typically be rejected due to their troubled financial profiles. Your job is to model the data from this experiment to create a decision-making algorithm that will help the bank decide how to respond to future credit card applications more profitably.

The following parties are NOT likely to be key stakeholder(s) in your project (select all that apply):

1 / 1 point

the bank’s creditors


**Individuals who applied for credit cards in the past, but were denied**

Correct
The individuals who applied for cards in the past or who will apply for cards in the future are not key stakeholders because their interests are not relevant to the bank’s goals of designing a model to maximize profits.


**Individuals who will apply for credit cards in the future.**

Correct
The individuals who applied for cards in the past or who will apply for cards in the future are not key stakeholders because their interests are not relevant to the bank’s goals of designing a model to maximize profits.


the bank’s shareholders


the bank, itself


## **Question 10**
At the beginning of any data analysis project, you should meet with your key stakeholders to understand:

1 / 1 point

what problem the business is experiencing that stakeholders hope to solve.


whether all the stakeholders agree about what business problem needs to be solved.


what types of effects or factors you should be considering in your data analysis.


what kinds of analytic tools and results the company culture will be open to.


**all of the above.**

Correct
You should aspire to achieve all these goals when you meet with your stakeholders.  Other goals of elicitation should include determining where your stakeholders’ true motivations and financial interests lie, defining stakeholders’ ideal outcomes of the project, and learning what’s been tried before in this area and why it did or did not work.

## **Question 11**
According to Doug Laney, VP of Information Innovation and Strategy at Gartner, why don’t more companies move higher on the analytics continuum?  (check all that apply)

1 / 1 point

**Inertia (comfort with the way businesses did things in the past)**

Correct
As your answer implies, although it is possible that the financial or personnel burden of implementing more sophisticated analytic solutions might contribute to companies’ resistance to move higher up the analytics continuum, neither of those items were among the reasons Doug Laney provided.


The financial burden of implementing more sophisticated data analytics is too high


**Decision-makers view analytic analyses as “black boxes” they don’t understand**

Correct
As your answer implies, although it is possible that the financial or personnel burden of implementing more sophisticated analytic solutions might contribute to companies’ resistance to move higher up the analytics continuum, neither of those items were among the reasons Doug Laney provided. 


Implementing analytic solution higher up on the analytics continuum would require hiring more skilled employees than the company could accommodate


## **Question 12**
True/False: When you are designing your business analysis plan, you should treat your business metric as the independent variable in your data analysis.

1 / 1 point

True


**False**

Correct
You should treat your business metric as the dependent variable in your data analysis.


## **Question 13**
SPAPs should be altered after you begin a data analysis.

1 / 1 point

**True**


False

Correct
SPAPs should be revised to add new hypotheses as they arise or cross out old ones that you know are no longer relevant.


## Question 14
How many layers should there be in the “independent variables” section of your pyramid? 

1 / 1 point

2


3


4


**As many layers and sub-layers as needed to cover all the issues you want to be sure you document or address**

Correct
Good! We demonstrated 2 layers of independent variables in the video, but you should include as many layers and sub-layers as needed to cover all the issues you want to be sure you document or address.


## **Question 15**
The best charts for assessing the categories and subcategories listed in the intermediate layers of your SPAP include (select all that apply):

1 / 1 point

**Bar charts**

Correct
 Bar charts are one of the most informative charts for assessing whether the independent variable in a category or subcategory affects your SMART metric. Note that there are other chart types that are also effective in assessing these elements.


**Scatter plots**

Correct
Scatter plots are one of the most informative charts for assessing whether the independent variable in a category or subcategory affects your SMART metric. Note that there are other chart types that are also effective in assessing these elements.


Pie charts


**Line charts**

Correct
Line charts are one of the most informative charts for assessing whether the independent variable in a category or subcategory affects your SMART metric. Note that there are other chart types that are also effective in assessing these elements.
